## 🛜 What is Routing?  

![Routing](public/assets/11.jpg)  

**Routing** is a mechanism in Laravel that connects URLs to specific logic or functions within your application. It’s responsible for handling all incoming requests and determining the appropriate response.  

In Laravel, routes are usually defined in the **`routes/`** folder. You can think of it as the map that guides how users interact with your web app! 🌐🗺️

## ⚡ Routing Methods  

Laravel provides **6 core HTTP methods** for routing:  

| Method   | Description               | Use Case             |  
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------|  
| **GET**    | Retrieves data              | Accessing pages or data |  
| **POST**   | Adds new data               | Submitting forms       |  
| **PUT**    | Updates entire data         | Replacing records      |  
| **PATCH**  | Updates partial data        | Updating specific fields |  
| **DELETE** | Removes data               | Deleting records       |  
| **OPTION** | Checks available methods   | API communication      |  

Here’s an example:  

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/home', function () {
    return view('home');
});

Route::post('/user', 'UserController@store');
Route::put('/user/{id}', 'UserController@update');
Route::delete('/user/{id}', 'UserController@destroy');
```

## 🏷️ Named Routes  

![Named Routes](public/assets/13.jpg)  

**Named Routes** in Laravel allow you to assign a name to a route, making it easier to reference in views, controllers, and redirects. It’s a great way to keep your code clean and readable!  

**Defining a Named Route:**  

```php
Route::get('/dashboard', 'DashboardController@index')->name('dashboard');
```

**Using a Named Route:**  

```php
// Redirecting
return redirect()->route('dashboard');

// Generating a URL
$url = route('dashboard');
```

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Group Routes  

![Group Routes](public/assets/16.jpg)  

**Group Routes** help organize routes that share the same attributes — like middleware, prefixes, or namespaces. This reduces redundancy and keeps your route definitions tidy.  

**Example of Grouping Routes:**  

```php
Route::prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', 'AdminController@dashboard');
    Route::get('/users', 'AdminController@users');
    Route::get('/settings', 'AdminController@settings');
});
```

In this example, all routes are automatically prefixed with `/admin`. Clean and simple! ✨
